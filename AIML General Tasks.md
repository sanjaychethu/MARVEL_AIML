## Task 1: Working with Pandas and Matplotlib

### Introduction
This task utilized **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to visualize the monthly launches of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The dataset sourced from ISRO's historical launch records offers insights into the organizationâ€™s launch activities over time. The Real Python tutorial on plotting with Matplotlib served as a reference for creating informative visualizations.

### Methodology
The analysis revolves around the manipulation of Pandas and the visualization of Matplotlib. The dataset focuses on ISRO launches on a monthly basis, providing the canvas for our visual exploration.

### Code Implementation
Embarking on our mission, we follow the footsteps of seasoned data explorers as outlined in the Real Python tutorial: [Pandas Plotting in Python (Guide)](https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/). Our aim is to unveil the narrative of ISRO's monthly launches through three distinct lenses: a line graph, a bar graph, and a scatter plot.

## Task 5: Get Familiar with the Command Line on Ubuntu

### Objective
Familiarize with the command line on Ubuntu and perform specified subtasks.

1. **Change Directory:** Moved into the "test" folder using the `cd` command.
2. **Blank File Creation:** Created a blank file named "blank_file.txt" using the `touch` command.
3. **Listing Files:** Checked the contents of the folder with `ls` to ensure the creation of the blank file.
4. **Multiple Folder Creation:** Used a loop to create 2600 folders named "M1", "M2", ..., "M2600". This can be modified based on the specific naming convention.
5. **Concatenating Text Files:** Assuming there are two text files "file1.txt" and "file2.txt", used the `cat` command to concatenate them and display the combined content on the terminal.

## Task 6: API

### Introduction
To explore the intricacies of API integration and its practical applications, I initiated a project to develop a weather app interface. The central components of this undertaking included the utilization of the OpenWeatherMap API and the integration of a jQuery plugin to seamlessly represent weather data.

### Resource Acquisition
I obtained essential resources by downloading the contents of the GitHub repository either from the jQuery website or through the provided link ([http://bitly.ws/CQRQ](http://bitly.ws/CQRQ)).

### Project Setup
After acquiring the necessary files, I meticulously copied the entire repository contents into a new directory on the desktop. This directory served as the foundation for subsequent development stages.

### API Integration
A critical step in this project was obtaining an API key from openweathermap.org. This key served as the gateway for accessing real-time weather data. The API key was seamlessly incorporated into the project code, enabling communication with OpenWeatherMap servers.

### jQuery Plugin Implementation
Leveraging the capabilities of a jQuery plugin, I facilitated the dynamic and user-friendly display of weather conditions. The plugin, sourced from the provided GitHub repository or the link ([http://bitly.ws/CQRY](http://bitly.ws/CQRY)), played a pivotal role in enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of the weather app interface.

```nginx
$(function() {
    $('.weather-temperature').openWeather({
        lang: 'ru',
        city: 'Bengaluru',
        placeTarget: '.weather-place',
        units: 'f',
        windSpeedUnit: 'Mps',
        descriptionTarget: '.weather-description',
        minTemperatureTarget: '.weather-min-temperature',
        maxTemperatureTarget: '.weather-max-temperature',
        windSpeedTarget: '.weather-wind-speed',
        humidityTarget: '.weather-humidity',
        sunriseTarget: '.weather-sunrise',
        sunsetTarget: '.weather-sunset',
        iconTarget: '.weather-icon',
        customIcons: '/img/icons/weather/',
        success: function() {
            $('.weather-temperature').show();
        },
        error: function(message) {
            console.log(message);
        }
    });
});
```

#### 2. LCD Display Setup
- Installed the driver library for the Liquid Crystal Display to interface with the LCD display.
- Searched for and installed the "LiquidCrystal I2C" library.
- Imported the header file "LiquidCrystal_I2C.h" in the code.
- Connected the SDA pin of the LCD display to the SDA pin of the Arduino Board and the SCL pin of the LCD display to the SCL of the Arduino Board.
- Connected VCC to the 5V pin and GND to the GND pin.

#### 3. Code Integration for LCD
Included the necessary code to define the display device.

```nginx


void setup(){
  lcd_1.begin(16, 2);
  lcd_1.print("distance: ");
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); // Sets the trigPin as an OUTPUT
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);  // Sets the echoPin as an INPUT
  // Serial Communication is starting with 9600 of baudrate speed
  Serial.begin(115200);
  // The text to be printed in serial monitor
  Serial.println("Distance measurement using Arduino Uno.");
  delay(500);
}

void loop(){
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2); // wait for 2 ms to avoid collision in serial monitor
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH); // turn on the Trigger to generate pulse
  delayMicroseconds(10); // keep the trigger "ON" for 10 ms to generate pulse for 10 ms.
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
}
```
